why am i not passing component like this <Profile/> in component key?
The core reason (simple words)

👉 JSX (<Profile />) is not a component definition — it is a component INSTANCE (already created UI)
👉 Profile (without <>) is just a function reference

React needs the component itself, not a rendered version of it.

Think of it like a function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

Passing function ❌ vs calling function
add        // ✅ function reference
add() //❌ function call (executes immediately)
What happens if you write <Profile /> in Tabs?
const Tabs = [
  {
    name: "Profile",
    Component: <Profile />
  }
];

Problems:

Component gets rendered immediately

You lose control over when it should render

You cannot do this later:

const ActiveComponent = Tabs[activeTab].Component;
<ActiveComponent /> // ❌ ERROR (not a component)


Because ActiveComponent is now JSX, not a function.

Why your approach works perfectly
const ActiveComponent = Tabs[activeTab].Component;


Here ActiveComponent is:

Profile  // or Interest or Setting


So React allows:

<ActiveComponent />


✅ Dynamic component rendering
✅ Clean
✅ Reusable
✅ Industry standard pattern

Rule to remember (interview-friendly)

When you want to render components dynamically, always store the component reference, not JSX.

When WOULD <Profile /> be okay?

If you are not rendering dynamically, then JSX is fine:

{activeTab === 0 && <Profile />}
{activeTab === 1 && <Interest />}


But for tabs / dynamic UI, your current pattern is the best one.

Short one-line answer (for interviews)

Because <Profile /> creates the element immediately, but Profile lets React decide when and which component to render dynamically.


i am making a project to create a tab form , and it is said that data needs to  be persistent , what does it mean

Good question 👍
This term “data needs to be persistent” is very common in real projects, and many beginners get confused by it.

I’ll explain it in simple words + with your tab form example.

What does “data needs to be persistent” mean?

👉 Persistent data means:

The data should NOT be lost when the UI changes, re-renders, or when you switch tabs.

In short:
User jo data enter kare, wo save rahe.

In your Tab Form context (very important)

You have tabs like:

Profile

Interest

Settings

Now imagine this flow 👇

❌ Without persistent data (bad UX)

User opens Profile tab

Types name: Kajal

Switches to Interest tab

Comes back to Profile tab

❌ Name input is EMPTY again

➡️ This means data is NOT persistent

✅ With persistent data (expected behavior)

User opens Profile tab

Types name: Kajal

Switches to Interest tab

Comes back to Profile tab

✅ Name is still there

➡️ This means data IS persistent

Why does data get lost in tab forms?

Because when you switch tabs:

<ActiveComponent />


Previous tab component unmounts

Its local useState is destroyed

New tab component mounts fresh

So:

useState("") // resets every time

So what is the solution?
🔑 Key idea:

State should live outside the tab components

This is called:

🧠 Lifting state up
Correct mental model
❌ Wrong approach (state inside each tab)
// Profile.jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("");


This state dies when tab changes ❌

✅ Correct approach (persistent state)
// TabForm.jsx
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: "",
  interests: [],
  settings: {}
});


Then pass data + setter to tabs:

<ActiveComponent 
  formData={formData}
  setFormData={setFormData}
/>


Now:

Tab changes ❌ don’t destroy data

Data remains ✅ persistent

Real-world meaning of persistence

Persistence can mean different levels, depending on project requirements:

1️⃣ UI-level persistence (your case)

Data survives tab switching

Uses useState in parent

2️⃣ Page refresh persistence

Data survives reload

Uses localStorage / sessionStorage

3️⃣ Backend persistence

Data saved in DB

Uses API
