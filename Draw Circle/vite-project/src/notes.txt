the problem that i got with using "fixed"
Where the bug is

Rendering circles:

style={{ position: "fixed", left: pos.x, top: pos.y }}

Why this is a bug ❌
Problem 1: fixed is relative to viewport

Coordinates are taken from e.clientX / e.clientY

Those are screen coordinates

Circles are not tied to the drawing area

Symptoms:

Scroll the page → circles drift

Resize window → positions break

Click inside box → circle may appear outside



The key rule 🧠 (remember this forever)

getBoundingClientRect() belongs to a DOM element, not React, not JavaScript globally.

You must call it on the element itself.

How do we get the element in React?

We use a ref.

Think of a ref as:

“Give me direct access to this HTML element.”
