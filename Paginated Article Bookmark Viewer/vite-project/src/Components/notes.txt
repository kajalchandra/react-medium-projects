i was using array.fill and passed null inside it , but because of null i was not able to filter or delete my array items
because at every index , null was present i was not able to do anything with that data

so i that to create a dummy object inside fill ({id:date.now} , text:"This is article")
it also causes problem because , you passed the function, not its value → all ids same , same object reference for all items

.. so i was adviced to use Array.from , why to use it?
because Array.from creates a new one each time. 

for objects → use Array.from

fill is only safe for primitives (number, string, null)

// problem that i faced in toggling part .
i used a global isSaved state , to jab value false ya true hoti thi , to wo sab article k liye apply ho jaati thi ,
jab ki har article ka independent boolean value hona chahiye tha , so we corrected it using an array when we saved the id that we click
or toggle , we saved a list of id's that we have clicked


// stale state of toggling
const handleShowBookmarked = ()=>{
    setShowBookMarked((prev)=> !prev)
    setCurrentPage(1)
     
   }

   Here’s the problem:

React batches state updates.

If some other code updates showBookMarked before this handler runs, !showBookmarked might use a stale value.

That means your toggle could flip in the wrong direction.
Imagine:

Current showBookmarked = false

User clicks checkbox twice very fast

Your code runs setShowBookMarked(!showBookmarked) twice

Step by step:

Click	showBookmarked (current)	!showBookmarked 	Result
1	        false	                    true	    sets true
2	still false                         true        sets true again
(React hasn't updated yet!)



How using prev => !prev fixes it
setShowBookMarked(prev => !prev)


React automatically passes the latest state as prev

Even if clicks happen quickly or other updates happen, the toggle always works correctly

Step by step with prev:

Click	prev	!prev	Result
1	    false	true	sets true
2	    true	false	sets false

/// important rule
🔹 Key Rule in React

Don’t store in state something that can be calculated from other state/props.
